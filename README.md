# cwl-examples
This repo is the home of various example cwl workflows. 

The aim is to collect high-quality, tested cwl templates for different kinds of actions: from running a script to running a nextflow pipeline, everything seems to be possible ðŸ§™
These examples can then also serve as POC that CWL is able to cover everything that potential users will need.

These templates could then be used to guide users through the process of making their research reproducible within the ARC environment (e.g. how to define dependencies of a script in a way to make it executable with the CWL runner). 

If you have an exmaple, feel free to submit a pull request!
